- Can you perform the main tasks of a site on any device?
- Are the button hit areas large enough for a finger/thumb?
- If something required click drag, did you cover swipe?
- Have you got feature detection? Can your site/app tell the difference between a click and a tap? a swipe?
- Are you making the visitor wait 300ms for a tap gesture?
- Are you aware of the different quirks between iOS to Android to Windows Phones?
- No unicode for hamburger menus
- Will a tap-drag (selection of text) cause a problem with your interface?
- If you used a fixed header on your site, did you try pinching your site to see if itâ€™s still good on a smaller device?
- How are you dealing with complex navigation? If you have a massively complex site structure have you provided in site search?
- If you're using offscreen navigation, have you put a containing div for the overflow hidden to deal with the Android body overflow hidden issue?
- Are you relying on hover for anything? Guess what you can't do on touch devices.
- Are you expecting the user to make discoveries without signposts? (eg. Swipe without any indication that they can swipe)
- Are you hijacking scroll, or hijacking the screen with modals?
- Are you embracing progressive enhancement for devices and browsers with less features?
