=======================

A checklist for friendly websites (accessible, performant, progressively enhanced, and portable device happy).

- Are you chunking content to allow for skim reading and ease of re-use?
- Has the content driven the design decisions, or has it been visa versa?
- Have you focused on cutting down to just the important stuff on the homepage instead of trying to cram everything on the one page? [Minimize cognitive load](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/)
